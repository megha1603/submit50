# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript\

In this program, a new aspect is introduced: API. With the use of Goodreads, we create a wed application for the website already existing. In the website, the user is able to the basic such as registration, logging in, and logging out. After accessing the website via creating an account, the user is able to access a list of 5000 different books using PostSQL database using the import.py link. After the user is logged in they are able to search for any book as well using a specific code like ISBN number or author name. When the user has accessed the book, they are now able to look at specific pages of a book as submit a review and look at other reviews. For future preference the rating of the books will be received by Goodreads and can access the GET request through API access.
